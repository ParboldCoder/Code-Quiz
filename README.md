# Code-Quiz Challenge

## Description
<br>
On this challenge I built a quiz using JavaScript across three seperate JavaScript files.
<br>
<br>
The logic is the largest section of code, as this code establishes a quiz application. 
<br>
It sets up key elements and event listeners for starting, displaying questions, giving feedback, managing a timer, and ending the quiz. Notably, it shuffles questions, checks answers, and handles highscore saving with initials.
<br>
<br>
The scores code does three main things. 
<br>
Firstly, it loads highscores from local storage when the page is fully loaded. 
<br>
Secondly, it displays these highscores on the webpage. 
<br>
Thirdly, it allows users to clear the displayed highscores by clicking a "Clear" button. The code handles these actions when the page loads and when the "Clear" button is clicked.
<br>
<br>
The questions.js is where I have a list of gaming questions with options and correct answers. 
<br>
To mix things up, I shuffled the order of the questions using a randomization technique. 
<br>
This way, when someone uses these questions, they get them in a random order each time, making the experience more interesting.
<br>
<br>
I did find this challenging and rewarding at the ennd when I eventually completed the task.
